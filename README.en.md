## 🔍 Overview
### 📄 About the Project
This project is a collaborative web development initiative aimed at creating a website for a gym to test our skills and learn about Full Stack integration. Using both Front-End and Back-End technologies, we are focused on building a functional product that includes areas for students and administrators. Our goal is to improve our skills, better understand the communication between development layers, and enhance our teamwork capabilities, both in project development and in coordinating the use of a shared repository, as well as to create a solid portfolio for future opportunities.

### 🏗 Structure and Architecture
The project follows the principles of **clean architecture**, and the code has been organized according to the principles of **modularity** and **reusability**.

In addition, we opted to use [***conventional commits***](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for better understanding and universal readability of the code.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
### 🌳 Forking the Repository
Before starting, you **should** 'fork' the project repository to **your profile**.
![Fork Repository](./src/assets/readme-images/fork.png)

### 🖨 Cloning Your Repository
After forking, you **will need** to clone the forked repository to your **local development environment**:

```
git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/projeto-academia.git
cd projeto-academia
```

### ⏬ Installing Dependencies
Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies using your respective ***package manager*** :

```
npm install
```
```
yarn install
```
```
pnpm install
```

### 🆕 Creating a Branch
Before starting any work, create a separate branch for your contribution.

Use a descriptive name for your branch, preferably using [***conventional commits***](#structure-and-architecture) as a basis:

```
git checkout -b <type>/<new-feature>
```
```
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### 🔨 Making Changes
Make the necessary changes to the code, add new features or bug fixes.

### 🧪 Testing (If necessary)
Ensure that your changes do not break any existing features. Run the tests and make sure they all pass:

```
npm run test
```
```
yarn test
```
```
pnpm test
```

### 📝 Documenting
Keep the documentation up-to-date. If you added new features, make sure they are properly documented in the README.

### 📊 Commits and Push
After completing your changes and testing them, commit the changes, prioritizing the use of [***conventional commits***](#structure-and-architecture):

(*Make sure you are on the new branch created*)
```
git add .
git commit -m <type>: <description>
```

Then, push your changes to the repository:

```
git push origin <type>/<new-feature>
```

### 📨 Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the repository on GitHub and create a Pull Request to have your contribution reviewed. Be sure to describe your changes and provide contextual information.

### 👁 Review and Merge
After creating a Pull Request, our team will review your changes and provide feedback. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main project.

### 💼 General Guidelines
- Keep the code clean and readable.
- Follow best development practices.
- Respect existing naming conventions.
- Properly document changes, features, or fixes.
